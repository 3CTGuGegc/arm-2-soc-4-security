**Introduction**  
In the digital age, understanding and mitigating vulnerabilities is crucial, as threats extend beyond software updates to hardware security, including technologies like Bluetooth and microchips. This mini-module focuses on Bluetooth hacking methods, cryptanalysis side-channel attacks, and microprocessor vulnerabilities.

**Bluetooth Hacking**  
Bluetooth technology, while convenient, presents various hacking risks:  
- **Bluesnarfing**: Unauthorized access to device information.  
- **Bluejacking**: Sending unsolicited messages.  
- **BlueSmacking**: Denial-of-Service attack on Bluetooth connections.  
- **Bluebugging**: Gaining control over a device.  
- **BlueBorne**: Vulnerabilities allowing control and malware spread.  
- **KNOB**: Weakening encryption during connection setup.  
- **BIAS**: Impersonating a trusted device during pairing.

**Cryptanalysis Side-Channel Attacks**  
These attacks exploit information from system implementation rather than algorithm weaknesses. Key topics include:  
- A brief history of side-channel attacks.  
- **Timing Attacks**: Exploiting computation time correlations.  
- **Power-Monitoring Attacks**: Analyzing power consumption to uncover data.

**Microprocessor Vulnerabilities**  
Microprocessors are essential but can be vulnerable due to design complexities. Key vulnerabilities include:  
- **Spectre** and **Meltdown**.  
Mitigation strategies involve:  
- **Retpoline**: Thwarting branch target injection.  
- Compiler modifications.  
- **Kernel Page Table Isolation (KPTI)**: Isolating kernel memory.  
- Microcode updates.

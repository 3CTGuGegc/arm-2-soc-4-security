### Side-Channel Attacks vs Fault Injection Attacks

**Side-Channel Attacks (SCAs)** and **Fault Injection Attacks (FIAs)** are two prominent types of attacks on cryptographic systems, focusing on different aspects of how these systems operate. Both methods aim to extract sensitive information but through different means.

### Side-Channel Attacks (SCAs)
**Mechanism:**
- **Passive Attack:** SCAs are passive; they do not alter the system's operation.
- **Data Collection:** These attacks exploit indirect information leaks from the physical implementation of cryptographic algorithms rather than weaknesses in the algorithms themselves. Common side channels include:
  - **Power Consumption:** Observing the power usage patterns during cryptographic operations (Differential Power Analysis - DPA)【6†source】.
  - **Electromagnetic Emissions:** Capturing electromagnetic signals emitted by the device (Electromagnetic Analysis - EMA).
  - **Timing Information:** Measuring the time taken to perform cryptographic operations (Timing Attacks)【6†source】.
  - **Acoustic Emissions:** Listening to sounds produced by electronic components during processing.

**Advantages:**
- **Non-Invasive:** SCAs do not require direct contact or modification of the device.
- **High Success Rate:** Effective against various implementations due to the inevitable physical leakage during operations.

**Disadvantages:**
- **Complex Setup:** Requires sophisticated equipment and expertise to capture and interpret the side-channel data accurately.
- **Environment Sensitivity:** Susceptible to environmental noise and variations, which can obscure the signals.

### Fault Injection Attacks (FIAs)
**Mechanism:**
- **Active Attack:** FIAs are active; they deliberately introduce faults into the system.
- **Fault Induction:** The attacker induces faults in the cryptographic device to create errors that can be exploited. Common methods include:
  - **Voltage Spikes:** Fluctuating the voltage supply to the device (e.g., glitching).
  - **Clock Glitching:** Manipulating the clock signal to cause timing errors.
  - **Laser/EM Pulses:** Directing precise laser or electromagnetic pulses at the device to disrupt its operation【7†source】.
  - **Temperature Variations:** Subjecting the device to extreme temperatures to induce faults.

**Advantages:**
- **Direct Interference:** Can bypass certain protections and force the device into revealing information.
- **Effective Against Tamper Resistance:** Particularly useful against devices designed with tamper-resistant features.

**Disadvantages:**
- **Potential Damage:** Risk of permanently damaging the device, making it unusable for further analysis.
- **Invasive Nature:** Typically requires physical access to the device, making remote attacks more challenging.

### Use Cases and Impacts
**Side-Channel Attacks:**
- **Cryptanalysis:** Effective in breaking cryptographic algorithms by revealing secret keys through leakage.
- **Security Testing:** Used in security evaluations to test the robustness of cryptographic implementations against leakage【6†source】.

**Fault Injection Attacks:**
- **Reverse Engineering:** Used to uncover internal device states and logic by observing how faults affect outputs.
- **Tamper Detection Testing:** Employed to test the resilience of security mechanisms against physical tampering【7†source】.

### Summary
- **SCAs** are best for passive observation of physical characteristics during cryptographic operations, useful for detecting weaknesses in implementation through non-invasive means.
- **FIAs** are active methods that induce faults to reveal internal states and vulnerabilities, suitable for bypassing protective measures and gaining insights through direct interference.

Each attack type requires specific skills, tools, and circumstances to be effective. The choice between SCAs and FIAs depends on the target device, the environment, and the attacker's objectives.
